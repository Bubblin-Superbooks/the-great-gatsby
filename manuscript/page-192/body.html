<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he "glanced into rooms" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea.</p><p>"Don't bring Tom," I warned her.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Don't bring Tom."</p><p>"Who is 'Tom'?" she asked innocently.</p><p>The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.</p></div> </div>
