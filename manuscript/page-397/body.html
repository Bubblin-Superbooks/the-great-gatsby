<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked "The Swastika Holding Company" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside. But when I'd shouted "Hello" several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.</p><p>"Nobody's in," she said. "Mr. Wolfshiem's gone to Chicago."</p><p>The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle "The Rosary," tunelessly, inside.</p></div> </div>
