<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.</p><p>Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM_</p><p>and then hasty addenda beneath:</p></div> </div>
