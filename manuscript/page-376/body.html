He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out under any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair.</p><p>Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.
