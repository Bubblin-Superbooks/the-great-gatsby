This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out "to see."</p><p>It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news.</p></div> </div>
