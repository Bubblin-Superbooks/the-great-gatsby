<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand.</p><p>"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?"</p><p>"Yes. You know what I think of you."</p><p>"You're crazy, Nick," he said quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you."</p></div> </div>
